parameter_space was ran once for collecting detailed timinings, output: "fmm_experiment_results_runtime only.xlsx"
	gpu kernel timings were wrong, ran again, but this time cpu functions timings are wrong, only gpu kernels are correct. output : 
test_comparing_speed.jl is only for comparing GPU and CPU total execution time
test_comparing_speed_volume.jl was run for collecting data volumes for GPU kernels. output: "fmm_experiment_results_volume.csv"
